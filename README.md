# Model-Evaluation
Data Analysis
We have built models and made predictions of vehicle prices. Now we will determine how accurate these predictions are. 
Model evaluation aims to estimate the generalization accuracy of a model on future (unseen/out-of-sample) data. Methods for evaluating a model's performance are divided into 2 categories: namely, holdout and Cross-validation. Both methods use a test set (i.e data not seen by the model) to evaluate model performance
